"aeternum.class.druid" tag no longer needed. 
The datapack will recognize you as a druid as long as you have a aeternum.ability.druid.level score of at least 1


aeternum.ability.druid.mana is the score for the energy used to cast/use abilities. As of now the abilities only need 50 to cast



Thorny vine ability is still WIP (Can't figure out how should I display the vines)

function class.druid:ability/bramble/cast

To cast Nutrition:

To cast Metamorphosis:
